# NBA_Project
An introduction project using NBA Data to predict an All-NBA Team. The data sources used were from Kaggle (Omri Goldstein) and Felix Donovan for the All NBA data.I wanted to see if I could replicate Felix Donovan's work on Kaggle and I am looking to adapt the code to see if I can predict an MVP (for future project). At the moment, there is no "final report", as this is just the code for the work. The file involves  cleaning the data set, performing logistic regressions and displaying visuals using ggplot package (part of the 'tidyverse' package). Random forest modelling was used to see if it can predict the All NBA team for a given year.
